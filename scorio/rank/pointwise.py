"""
Pointwise ranking methods.

Pointwise methods aggregate each model's item-level performance into one scalar
without explicit head-to-head modeling.

Notation
--------

Let :math:`R \\in \\{0,1\\}^{L \\times M \\times N}` and define
:math:`k_{lm}=\\sum_{n=1}^{N} R_{lmn}`,
:math:`\\widehat{p}_{lm}=k_{lm}/N`.

The pointwise score template is

.. math::
    s_l = \\sum_{m=1}^{M} w_m \\, g\\!\\left(\\widehat{p}_{lm}, \\phi_m\\right),

where :math:`\\phi_m` is an item statistic, :math:`g` is a fixed transform,
and :math:`w_m` are nonnegative weights.

    Rank models by inverse-difficulty-weighted per-question accuracy.

    Method context:
        This pointwise method upweights hard questions by assigning each
        question an inverse weight proportional to the reciprocal global solve
        rate. It emphasizes rare successes while still aggregating all
        questions into one scalar score per model.

    References:
        Inverse probability weighting (Wikipedia):
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_probability_weighting

    Args:
        R: Binary outcome tensor with shape ``(L, M, N)`` or matrix
            ``(L, M)`` (treated as ``N=1``).
        method: Tie-handling rule passed to :func:`scorio.utils.rank_scores`.
            One of ``"competition"``, ``"competition_max"``, ``"dense"``,
            or ``"avg"``.
        return_scores: If ``True``, return ``(ranking, scores)``.
        clip_range: Two-sided clipping interval ``(a, b)`` applied to global
            solve rates before inversion. Must satisfy
            ``0 < a < b <= 1``.

    Returns:
        Ranking array of shape ``(L,)``.
        If ``return_scores=True``, also returns inverse-difficulty scores of
        shape ``(L,)``.

    Notation:
        ``k_lm = sum_{n=1}^N R_lmn`` and
        ``p_hat_lm = k_lm / N``.
        The global per-question solve rate is
        ``p_bar_m = (1/L) * sum_l p_hat_lm``.

    Formula:
        .. math::
            w_m \\propto \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{clip}(\\bar p_m, a, b)},
            \\quad \\sum_{m=1}^{M} w_m = 1

        .. math::
            s_l^{\\mathrm{inv\\text{-}diff}} =
            \\sum_{m=1}^{M} w_m \\, \\widehat{p}_{lm}

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from scorio import rank
        >>> R = np.array([
        ...     [[1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 0]],
        ...     [[0, 0], [1, 1], [0, 0]],
        ... ])
        >>> ranks, scores = rank.inverse_difficulty(R, return_scores=True)
        >>> ranks.tolist()
        [1, 1]
        >>> scores.shape
        (2,)

        >>> # tighter clipping is allowed
        >>> rank.inverse_difficulty(R, clip_range=(0.05, 0.95)).shape
        (2,)

    Notes:
        Very small clip lower bounds can make the weighting highly sensitive
        to a few rare solves. This implementation is a simple inverse-weighted
        pointwise scorer.
