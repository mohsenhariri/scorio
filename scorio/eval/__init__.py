r"""Evaluation metrics and uncertainty estimators.

This module implements evaluation methods for model response tensors
 (``R``) used in ``scorio`` evaluation workflows.

Notation
--------
Let :math:`R \in \{0,\ldots,C\}^{M \times N}` be an outcome matrix.

- :math:`M` is the number of questions.
- :math:`N` is the number of trials per question.
- :math:`R_{\alpha i}` is the outcome for question :math:`\alpha` on trial
  :math:`i`.

Binary metrics use :math:`R \in \{0,1\}^{M \times N}`.

Return Pattern
---------------------
Point estimators return a scalar score. Companion ``*_ci`` functions return
``(mu, sigma, lo, hi)``, where ``mu`` is the estimated score, ``sigma`` is the
posterior standard deviation under the method assumptions, and ``lo`` and
``hi`` define a normal-approximation credible interval.

``tailpass`` returns a posterior profile with joint covariance and reusable
utility methods. ``tailpass_empirical`` returns a finite-bank profile array.
TailPass credible intervals can use shared posterior Monte Carlo draws.

Available Families
------------------
- Bayes family: ``bayes`` and ``bayes_ci``.
- Average family: ``avg`` and ``avg_ci``.
- Pass family: ``pass_at_k`` and ``pass_hat_k`` with their ``*_ci`` variants.
- AUC@K family: ``auc_at_k`` and ``auc_at_k_ci``.
- Majority family: ``maj_at_k`` and ``maj_at_k_ci``.
- Generalized pass family: ``g_pass_at_k``, ``g_pass_at_k_tau``,
  ``mg_pass_at_k``, and their ``*_ci`` variants.
- Geometric family: ``geom_at_k``/``geom_at_k_ci``,
  ``geom_ds_at_k``/``geom_ds_at_k_ci``,
  ``geo_spectrum_at_k``/``geo_spectrum_at_k_ci``,
  ``threshold_spectrum_at_k``/``threshold_spectrum_at_k_ci``,
  and ``geo_spectrum_star_at_k``/``geo_spectrum_star_at_k_ci``.
  ``geom_at_k`` is the questionwise geometric blend; ``geom_ds_at_k`` is the
  dataset-level Pass/Unanimous blend.
- Max-reward family: ``max_at_k`` and ``max_at_k_ci``.
- TailPass profiles: ``tailpass`` and ``tailpass_empirical``.
