/**
 * Scorio evaluates repeated outcomes, ranks models, and selects sampled answers.
 *
 * This entry point exposes the evaluation metrics under the `eval` namespace,
 * mirroring `import scorio; scorio.eval.bayes(...)` in Python:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { eval as scorioEval } from "scorio";
 * const [mu, sigma] = scorioEval.bayes([0, 1, 1]);
 * ```
 *
 * The metrics are also importable directly from `scorio/eval`.
 *
 * Ranking estimators live under the `rank` namespace (`scorio.rank.borda(...)`)
 * and are also importable directly from `scorio/rank`.
 *
 * Sequential-inference helpers live under the `sinf` namespace
 * (`scorio.sinf.shouldStop(...)`) and are also importable from `scorio/sinf`.
 *
 * Test-time-scaling aggregation lives under `aggregate` (with short alias
 * `agg`) and is also importable directly from `scorio/aggregate`.
 *
 * Ranking comparison and collision-free ranking hashes live under `utils`
 * and are also importable directly from `scorio/utils`.
 *
